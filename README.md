# Dynamic Form Builder System

üìö **Project Overview**  
The Dynamic Form Builder is a fully functional, responsive ASP.NET Core MVC web application that allows users to create, edit, and preview customizable forms by dynamically adding dropdown fields. The system leverages AJAX and SweetAlert2 for real-time interactivity and uses ADO.NET with raw SQL for data persistence, avoiding Entity Framework or LINQ.
