💡 Project Overview
 The Dynamic Form Builder is a fully functional, responsive web application where users can create, edit, and preview customizable forms by dynamically adding dropdown fields. It emphasizes real-time interactivity with AJAX + SweetAlert2 and stores data using ADO.NET with raw SQL (no EF Core or LINQ).
This project showcases my ability to build form-based systems, implement raw SQL in a modern ASP.NET MVC environment, and manage data persistence securely.
